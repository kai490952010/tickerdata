Tickerdata
----------

Tickerdata intends to provide a consistent interface to financial market data APIs and make it easier to collect this data.

All APIs listed here would be mostly available as open source but (sometimes) may require API key access.
It is up to the user to make resposible use of it in a way access to the API is not throttled by the provider.

Further documentation is coming soon.
